This project successfully deploys a High Availability (HA) Web Cluster using a fully redundant, two-node setup on RHEL 9. The system's primary goal is to provide zero-downtime access to a web service. This is achieved by having Nginx run the actual website content on port 8080 on both nodes. HAProxy is then configured to listen on the public port 80 and load-balance client requests across these two Nginx backends using a round-robin algorithm. Crucially, Keepalived implements the VRRP protocol to manage a Floating Virtual IP (VIP), ensuring that if the MASTER node fails, the BACKUP node automatically and instantly assumes the VIP address. This configuration allows traffic to alternate between Node 1 and Node 2, verifying both load balancing and active/backup failover functionality, creating a robust web service with no single point of failure.
